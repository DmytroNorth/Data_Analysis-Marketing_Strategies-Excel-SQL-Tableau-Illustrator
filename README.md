# Cyclistic-Data-Analysis
This is a capstone project for **Google Data Analytics** course. I used real-world data provided by a bike-sharing company in Chicago. The goal was to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.

* The final [__Cyclistic data analysis presentation__](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dJFRqilNzjHMs279K3sWfbKWjDg61FYBVdgC7RNCG_w/edit?usp=sharing) is available at **Google Slides.** 
* Detailed documentation is available in Kaggle kernel.
* **Microsoft Excel** has been used for the initial assessment of a portion of data. 
* Processing, cleaning, validation, and analysis were done in **SQLite Studio.**
* Further analysis was done in **Tableau Public** and can be viewed at [**Cyclistic Data Analysis Tableau**](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/dmnorth/viz/CyclisticDataAnalysisTableau/select) project.
* Visualization and slideshow presentation was designed in **Adobe Illustrator**.
