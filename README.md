# Cyclistic-Data-Analysis
This is a capstone project for Google Data Analytics course. I used real-world data provided by a bike-sharing company in Chicago. The goal was to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.

* The final Cyclistic data analysis presentation is available at Google Slides.
* Detailed documentation is available in Kaggle kernel.
* Microsoft Excel has been used for the initial assessment of a portion of data.
* Processing, cleaning, validation, and analysis were done in SQLite Studio.
* Further analysis was done in Tableau Public and can be viewed at Cyclistic Data Analysis Tableau project.
* Visualization and slideshow presentation was designed in Adobe Illustrator.
